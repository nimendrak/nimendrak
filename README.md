## About

As a DevSecOps & Platform Engineer with nearly 4 years of experience across SRE and DevSecOps, I specialize in delivering secure, automated, and high-performing systems in multi-cloud environments. I’ve consistently applied best practices in CI/CD, infrastructure, and observability to drive reliability, reduce risk, and elevate platform performance.

I’m passionate about embedding security across the software delivery lifecycle - bridging development, operations, and security to build resilient systems. I’ve led zero-downtime cloud migrations, implemented SLO-driven reliability frameworks, and championed engineering initiatives that helped teams scale confidently and securely.

Known for working seamlessly across product, engineering, and QA, I bring a strategic, hands-on approach to solving complex challenges and delivering scalable, end-to-end solutions.
